    <h1>Buying a house ? How difficult is it</h1>
    <div id="world_pop"></div>
    <p><span style ="font-family: Neue Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This chart is showing the total population from year 2010 to 2021</span></p>
    <h1>Fourth vega-lite graph</h1>
    <div id="average_income"></div>
    <p><span style ="font-family: Neue Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></span>First, lets take a look on how rent rate index relates to living cost of people. The way to interpret this chart is that 
    <br>100 is the average living cost of the control variable which is newyork then 120 means its 20% more expensive, 
    <br>and 120 rent index means its 20% more expensive to rent than to buy. So as we can see here its the top 50 most expensive countries 
    <br>we can really see that there is a general trend where more expensive countries have higher rent prices.
    </span> </p>
    <div id="crime_rate">
    <p><span style ="font-family: Neue Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></span>Secondly, we are showing the relation between crime rate and cost of living. It is clearly shown where
      <br>the yellow color is crime index and the green one is cost of living, higher crimed country have lower living cost such as Afghanistan.
      <br>
      <br>However, the second chart on the right shows the top 10 safest countries and we can see that it is the other way around ! 
      <br>we can really see that that safer countries mean that living cost is higher too. 
      </span> </p>
    </div>
    <div id="safest_countries"></div>
    <div id="rent_by_age"></div><p><span style ="font-family: Neue Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></span>These days, it is getting harder and harder to own a home 
      with the constant increase of living cost for the sake of safety 
      <br>and comfort, we shown in the chart, only 2.9% of people between the age of 25-34 owns a home without mortgage while 
      <br>37% with mortgage. While the number did increases to 5%for the age group 35-44. It means that our salary is not enough 
      <br>for us to own our own home debt free. That is why we need to be more educated in terms of financial freedom and investments.s
